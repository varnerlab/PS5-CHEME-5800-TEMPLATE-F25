    "# PS5: The Apples Versus Oranges Problem as a Markov Decision Process\n",
    "Problem set 5 (PS5) tests the hypothesis that a classical optimization problem, such as selecting the optimal consumption bundle of apples and oranges, can be structured as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where an optimal policy can be computed using value iteration. Toward this objective, there are two problems that we need to solve:\n",

    "* __Problem 1__: In this problem, we solve the apples and oranges problem subject to a budget constraint as a nonlinear programming problem [using the `MadNLP.jl` package](https://github.com/MadNLP/MadNLP.jl). The optimal solution to this problem will be used as the terminal state for the MDP calculations.\n",
    "* __Problem 2__: In this problem, we construct an MDP problem encoding the apples and oranges decision and solve for the optimal policy function $\\pi$ using value iteration. In this problem, we enforce the budget constraint as a soft-wall constraint and use reward shaping to help the search.\n",

    "In this task, we generate the components of the MDP problem from our `MyRectangularGridWorldModel` instance. The MDP problem requires the reward function (or array) $R(s, a)$ and the transition function (or array) $T(s, s^{\\prime}, a)$. Let's construct these from our grid world model instance, starting with the $R(s, a)$ reward function.\n",

After initializing the reward `R::Array{Float64,2}` array with zeros, populate the non-zero values of $R(s, a)$ using a nested [for loop](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#for). During each outer loop iteration, we select a state $s\\in\\mathcal{S}$, and the inner loop iterates over actions $a\\in\\mathcal{A}$.\n",

If the `new_position`$\\in\\mathcal{S}$ is in our initial `rewards` dictionary, we use that reward value. If we are still in the world but not in a special location, we set the reward to `-1`. If `new_position`$\\notin\\mathcal{S}$, i.e., the `new_position` is a space outside the grid, we set a penalty of `-50000.0`.\n",

    "We demonstrated that the apples and oranges resource allocation problem can be formulated and solved as a Markov Decision Process using value iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Key takeaways:\n",
    "> * The optimal consumption bundle from nonlinear programming (Problem 1) served as the terminal state for the MDP, providing a clear goal for the value iteration algorithm to converge toward.\n",
    "> * Reward shaping with the Cobb-Douglas utility function $U(x)$ guided the MDP search by providing intermediate feedback, while soft-wall penalties enforced the budget constraint without hard boundaries.\n",
    "> * Value iteration successfully computed an optimal policy $\\pi^{\\star}(s)$ that navigates from any starting state to the optimal consumption bundle while respecting the budget constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach shows how classical optimization problems can be reframed as sequential decision-making problems, opening pathways to solve more complex resource allocation scenarios with uncertainty and dynamic constraints.\n",
